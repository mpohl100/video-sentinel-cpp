1) introduce bounding rectangle for webcam app -> done
2) use taskflow to parallelize the processing of rectangles (without zipping the rectangles) -> done
3) implement zipping of the rectangles (a bit unknown how to at the moment)
4) implement reverse parsing of slices to get the complete object guaranteed in two phases
5) implement standard deviation of angles as a factor to the gradient number of a pixel (goal is to remove small rectangles in the source data)
